# Note

We need to compile this contract using solidity version
`0.8.18`. This is because the EVM version in the emulator
is only up to the `paris` upgrade. Before we upgrade the emulator,
we need to use an older version of `solc`. 
Version `0.8.18` of `solc` can be downloaded from 
[here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.18)
